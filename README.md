# Explicit Planning under Compute Constraints: A Search-Based Autonomous Agent

Will be implementing a model-based autonomous agent using A* and BFS to study how planning depth and heuristic admissibility affect success, optimality, and runtime in long-horizon tasks. Will also build a reproducible evaluation harness with instrumentation and failure-mode analysis
